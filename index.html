          <div class= "text">
      <p>I have always been interested in languages. <br/> I can fluently speak, read and write in French, English, Spanish and Japanese. <br/> My passion for this comes from the fact that I have Asperger's Syndrome (a form of high functioning Autism) which makes me constantly challenge myself in an effort to be able to better communicate with others.</p>

      <p>Another passion of mine is Japanese Manga and Anime, which led me to study and learn Japanese. <br/> About 18 months ago, I started to edit and contribute data on the wiki page of <a href='http://kyokainorinne.wikia.com/wiki/User:Zorianff9' style="font-weight:bold; color:white">Kyδkai no Rinne</a> in order to improve its content and make the information given more precise and complete, and as an homage to Rumiko Takahashi, the author, whom I greatly admire for her prolific 40 years of continuous creation. <br/> It was through this experience that I became interested in coding- a new language for me to learn and master.</p>

      <p>Founders & Coders could be a great opportunity for me due to my neurodiversity. <br/> I am on the mild side of the autism spectrum, which means I function normally; but have the capacity to pursue activities with a passion for long periods of time and become very good at them. <br/> I'm also very patient, calm and a good teacher. <br/> I would like to be able to earn my living, by coding, creating and improving pages.</p>

      <p>Also, I have a long-time project of my own, on which I have been working for a couple of years; and being able to share its content and post it online seems like the perfect solution for this. <br/> The objective would be to share some of the experiences which I have had and what I have learned about life throughout my journey, and perhaps create a platform for others to do so as well, and a community which helps each other.</p>
