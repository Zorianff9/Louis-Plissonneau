    <p>I have always been interested in languages. I can fluently speak, read and write in French, English, Spanish and Japanese. <br/> My passion for this comes from the fact that I have Asperger's Syndrome (a form of high functioning Autism) which makes me constantly challenge myself in an effort to be able to better communicate with others.</p>

    <p>Another passion of mine is Japanese Manga and Anime, which led me to study and learn Japanese.  About 18 months ago, I started to edit and contribute data on the wiki page of KyÎ´kai no Rinne in order to improve its content and make the information given more precise and complete, and as an homage to Rumiko Takahashi, the author, whom I greatly admire for her prolific 40 years of continuous creation.  It was through this experience that I became interested in coding- a new language for me to learn and master.</p>

    <p>Founders and Coders could be a great opportunity for me due to my neurodiversity.  I am on the mild side of the autism spectrum, which means I function normally; but have the capacity to pursue activities with a passion for long periods of time and become very good at them.  I'm also very patient, calm and a good teacher.  I would like to be able to earn my living, by coding, creating and improving pages.</p>

    <p>Also, I have a long-time project of my own, on which I have been working for a couple of years; and being able to share its content and post it online seems like the perfect solution for this.  The objective would be to share some of the lessons about life which I have learned throughout my journey.</p>
